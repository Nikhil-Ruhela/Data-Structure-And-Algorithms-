/* C++ STL -> Standard Template Library
 CONTAINER: A Data stracture which is preinplimented in STL
 (1)-> Sequencial container:  It is a type of array
    (a) Vector 
    (b) Stack
    (c) Queue
    (d) Pair (not a contaier)

 (2)-> Ordered container: Values are stored in sorted order
      (a) Map  
      (b) Multimap
      (c) Set
      (d) Multyset

 (3)-> Unordered container: It is based of the algorithm like #
      (a) Unoudered map   
      (b) Unoudered set

 NESTED CONTAINER: It is a container in another container
     (a) vector<vector<int>>
     (b) map<int , vector<int>>
     (c) set<pair<int,string>>
     (d) vector<map<int , set<int>>>

  ITERATORS: Similar to pointers but implimented to STL containers,point to memory address of container
  ->begin()
  ->end()   
  ->vector<int>::iterator it;

  ALGORITHMS: Implimented in C++ STL
  (a) upper bound
  (b) lower bound
  (c) sort (comparator)
  (d) max_element
  (e) min_element
  (f) accumulate : to find the sum of array
  (g) reverse
  (h) count
  (i) find
  (j) next_permutations
  (k) previous_permutauions

  Functors:Classes in c++ Which is use as a function
